# Purple Team Roadmap 🚀

Welcome! This repo is my journey through the Purple Team roadmap, blending **red team attack simulations** and **blue team detections**.

## 📌 Goals
- Build hands-on detection engineering and threat hunting experience.
- Document attack → detection → response mappings.
- Share custom Snort, Suricata, and Sigma detection rules.
- Track weekly progress and lessons learned.

## 🛠️ Tools Covered
Snort | Suricata | Zeek | Splunk | Elastic | Wazuh | Sysmon | Atomic Red Team | Caldera

## 📂 Repo Structure
- `detections/` → Custom rules
- `hunting-playbooks/` → Threat hunting guides
- `labs/` → Purple Team exercises
- `reports/` → Capstone reports
